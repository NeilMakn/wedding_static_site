        <h4>The Couple</h4>
        <p>
    Legend says that Kendra and Neilson met in kindergarden. Apparently Kendra laughed at Neilson when he got sent to time-out for saying "butt". Kendra doesn't remember this, she was too busy drawing on herself with markers. Fast forward to high school: Neilson swore less and Kendra decided to switch to drawing on herself with pens. They met in English class junior year, and Kendra was attracted to Neilson's puns and silly songs. Neilson was drawn to Kendra's sweet demeanor, smarts, and good looks. Their flirtation caused them to get in trouble in history class, but culminated in prom, dates, graduation, moving to another city, and developing a deep sense of companionship, trust, and love.

    <h4>The Proposal</h4>

      It happened on April 28th, 2013. It was at Mt. Tabor.
      There was sun, it was under a tree.
      Neilson proposed on his stomach, and not his knee.

    <h4>Kendra</h4>
       <p>Kendra is a year older than Neilson and a Portland, Oregon native. She's always on the go as a store manager, but when she slows down, she's a voracious reader. Ask her about the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Outlander, Harry Potter, and she'll talk your ear off about them over a cup of tea. She's a kind person who helps others, and is always sincere to even the most grouchy individuals (Neilson). Kendra is a fantastic friend you can rely on, and an amazing beau. Too bad she's already been snatched up.</p>

      <h4>Neilson</h4>
      <p>This handsome man, born in the summer of '89, was raised and currently residing in Portland, Oregon. He is renowned for his contagious laugh, which can be easily elicited from the simplest cat video. When not giggling at cat videos, he spends his time pretending to solve puzzles, learning to code, cooking, and making puns. His charming smile and hopeless romantic spirit swept Kendra off her feet.  </p>
